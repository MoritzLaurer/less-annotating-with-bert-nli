It’s bad enough that the unemployment rate has doubled in only a year and a half and one out of six construction workers is out of work. What truly troubles President Obama’s economic advisers is that, even adjusting for the recession, the contraction in employment seems way too high. As one administration official said, “This has been a very steep job loss.’’ One proof, he added, is that the country is deviating from the standard (among economists) jobs predictor known as Okun’s Law.</br></br>Tn the 1960s, Arthur Okun, a prominent economist, claimed to ""have discovered a mathematical relationship between the decline in output (that is, goods and services produced) and the rise in unemployment. It held up pretty well until recently. But this time around, although the decline in output would have predicted a rise in unemployment to 8 percent, the actual jobless rate has soared to 9.5 percent. So this recession is killing off jobs even faster than the things — like automobiles, houses, computers and newspapers — that jobholders produce.</br></br>The Federal Reserve now expects unemployment to surpass 10 percent (the postwar high was 10.8 percent in 1982).

Usually during recessions, firms keep most of their employees on the payroll even as business slows, in effect stockpiling them for better days. In the current downturn, hoarding seems to have gone into reverse. Not only are firms laying off redundant workers, but they seem to be cutting into the bone. Hall says the absence of hoarding means that firms do not expect business to pick up soon. This is supported by other evidence, like a doubling in the number of involuntary part-time workers (there arc nine million of them) and the shrinking workweek, now 33 hours — the shortest ever recorded. Presumably, before companies start to rehire laid-off workers, they will psk their current employees to work more.",test,nyt_1030648729,,negative

ONE big reason for the angry | mood of many voters last f week was pain in the pock-etbook, actual or expected, from sinking incomes, lost jobs, failing businesses, higher fuel prices and rising taxes. Even more disturbing than the perceived pain was a gnawing anxiety that the American economy might be headed not just for another brief recession, the 10th of the post-World War II period, but for a real depression.</br></br>Despite the headaches that are the hangover of the wild excesses of the 1980’s, the United States economy has not yet cracked, nor is it inevitable that it will. But those who believe that anxiety is warranted say the nation’s weakened financial structure might buckle if the economy goes into steep decline. James J. O’Leary, economic consultant to the United States Trust Company of New York, ticks off some major areas of stress: • As corporate profits decline, heavy interest payments on outstanding debt are increasing the risk, or reality, of business failures and creating rising losses for lending institutions. Cost-cutting and layoffs are the order of the day. Productivity is picking up, but the job losses and falling incomes are chopping into sales.</br></br>• Many commercial banks and life insurance companies are experiencing high and rising delinquency and foreclosure rates, and losses on their mortgage and business loans. Declining real estate prices in some areas are increasing the losses.</br></br>• The junk bonds issued during the go-go years, now gone, are raising grave problems for the corporations that used them to finance mergers and acquisitions, and for the people and institutions that acquired the bonds.</br></br>• Belatedly reacting to the savings and loan debacle, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency are tightening • credit standards, especially on commercial mortgage loans. Banks and life insurance companies are far less willing to make such loans, except on terms that better reflect the risks. Bond rating agencies are lowering the ratings of some commercial banks and insurance companies, making it costlier for them to borrow. The slowing economy and the falling dollar, now at its lowest level ever against the German mark and Swiss franc, are stanching the flow of foreign capital to the United States.

Unless two wild cards turn up, we can expect short-term rates to drop 1.5 percentage points and long yields to fall half as much within six months.”</br></br>The two wild cards, Mr. Straszheim said, were a further deterioration in the ""fragile commercial banking industry and a sharp rise in the debt levels of all sectors of the economy.”</br></br>As it was, the discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills fell to 7.13 percent Friday from 7.37 percent the week before, while at the long end the yield on the benchmark 30-year bonds declined to 8.93 percent from 9.12 percent.

That is more than a full percentage point lower than the 3.5 percent projection for next year that the Administration made in August.</br></br>The unemployment rate, the forecast projects, will remain at current levels during 1988, while the consumer inflation rate and interest rates are to decline by about half a percentage point.</br></br>The Administration's projections are only slightly more optimistic in the aggregate than those of most private forecasters.

The recent decline in wholesale prices of oil products has reduced materially the profit margin of the refining branch of the industry. The companies that purchase all their crude oil in the open market are having some difficulty in making ends meet and several already have had to reduce operations.</br></br>At the end of March, refiners on the Gulf Coast had a gross margin of about $1 a barrel on all crude oil processed, based on their average prices for the four major products—gasoline, kerosene and light and heavy fuel oil. Prom this they had to deduct all operating expenses. At present 'prices, it is estimated that their gross margin has been reduced, to 60 cents. For some of the less efficient refineries, such a margin is not sufficient to cover operating expenses.</br></br>In the past twenty years, there have been only a few times when the refinery margin has been as low or lower, and these were in the pre-war period when crude oil prices were substantially lower. In 1935 when the price of crude' oil averaged $1 a barrel, refiners received an average of $1.67 a barrel for the four refined products, a gross margin of 67 cents. The low level was in the recession of 1938, when the margin dropped to 51 cents. In the war years, it held around 80 cents, increasing to 92 cents in 1947.</br></br>Those companies that produce substantially all of their crude oil are not materially affected by the reduction in the refinery margin, for any loss in refining oper- ations may be absorbed by the crude oil production department. Instead of SI a barrel for crude . oil, as in 1935, the average pride east of the Rocky Mountains now is $2.87 a barrel.</br></br>About a year ago, the price of crude oil was increased by 25 cents a barrel.

WASHINGTON — The report last week of yet another strong rise in the Consumer Price Index, this time for July, raised again a nagging question: Just when is the Government’s much heralded anti-inflation program going to start working?</br></br>The elements of the program are simple and classic. The twin pillars are a surplus in the budget and a monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board that aims at drastically slowing the expansion of money and credit in the economy from the pace of recent years. From all the evidence, the policy is right on track, especially now that Congress has extended the income tax surcharge until the end of the year, at least.</br></br>And yet it is not only the price level that apparently is failing to respond. The pace of the economy was slowed a little from that of the hectic boom of 1968, but not very much. The gross national product is st:ll rising by $16-billion a quarter, which is a very hefty boost in total demand in the economy, even though the whole thrust of Government policy is aimed at checking demand.</br></br>The economic indicators for July point to more of the same — that is, little evidence of the desired slowdown. Industrial production rose a strong seven-tenths of one per cent, personal income soared as a result in part of the big Federal pay raise, employment continued to rise and new orders for durable goods jumped after sagging for two months. Only retail sales continued fairly sluggish, though even they went up a little in July.</br></br>It is an ironic reflection on the economic profession—though not all members of it—that only a year ago, shortly after passage of the surcharge, there was fairly widespread fear of “overkill.” The worry was that the economy would slow too fast and too much, with a significant impact on unemployment.",test,nyt_118553172,,positive

Almost half of last month’s troubling increase in inflation is directly traceable to rising energy prices. The message, therefore, should be clear: the energy and inflation problems are inseparably bound. No one is 'going to solve the inflation problem without first solving the energy problem.</br></br>'Taking into account the indirect costs of energy that are embedded in the other products we buy, about 10 percent of consumer expenditures go for buying energy. If energy prices go up 60 percent, then energy by itself will create an extra 6 percentage points of inflation. It is an algebraic fact of life that this extra inflation can be avoided only if prices fall for the remaining 90 percent of consumer spending. To be precise, all other spending would have to fall by 6.7	percent to counteract a 60 percent rise in energy prices. Falling prices, however, mean falling wages, salaries and dividends for everyone outside the energy business; inflation would not be rising, but money</br></br>So while there are conceivable Government policies that might force down other prices to offset energy costs — policies to induce a very severe recession — they involve enormous social costs and are unlikely to be adopted. Inevitably, then, so long as energy prices-accelerate, so will inflation. And if energy consumers attempt to recoup lost ground by indexing their wages to the cost of living, the resultant increase in inflation will simply become some multiple of the original increase in energy prices.</br></br>In Washington, therefore, the key new man on inflation may not be Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve Board but Charles Duncan at the Department of Energy. There is no cure for inflation without a cure for the energy shortage. That is a stark but simple fact, which must impress itself on the President and the entire political system.</br></br>The more we think about it, the more we like the novel idea for saving energy offered recently in our Letters column by Nancy Dorfman, a transportation economist at M.I.T.

Even President Reagan dares mention it, though only to dismiss it as impossible. This season’s vision of apocalypse is depression, replacing last season's fascination with Weimar inflation.</br></br>The reason is plain. Although the current economic downturn has thus far cut no deeper than the nasty recession of 1974-75, it has revealed unsuspected fragility in highly visible industries. Steel, automobiles, airlines, housing, savings banks, trucking, farm machinery, lumber — all are experiencing the hardest times since the 1930’s.</br></br>The recession has also cast doubt on Government’s capacity — and perhaps even will — to take swift remedial measures. For more than a decade, the economy has lurched from inflation to stagnation, seemingly out of Washington’s control. And President Reagan’s performance at the helm has convinced practically no one that happier days are just ahead.</br></br>Does that mean a depression is indeed likely? The odds are against it. Economists and politicians may be unable to deliver the promised prosperity and stable growth. But an enormous Institutional bulwark still stands between recession and the 1930’s-style collapse. Those Institutions are suffi- ciently strong to protect the economy from great, irreversible damage, even if Washington took months to recognize the seriousness of the problem.</br></br>•	Between 1929 and 1933, national Income fell 29 percent; unemployment rose from 3.2 percent to 24.9 percent. What was Government’s fiscal response? There was none. Attempts to maintain tax revenues in the face of falling incomes actually contributed to the decline. Today, any comparable decline In private purchasing power would be in part offset automatically by Government social spending. And political pressure for direct action — tax cuts, emergency employment programs—would be enormous.",test,nyt_121927034,,negative

But the inventories mean the cars were not sold and they are not a signal of sustainable economic growth. In fact, the buildup could mean a cut in production this quarter, which would slow the economy.</br></br>Some of the increase was also a result of technical changes and revisions in the gross national product numbers back to 1977.

3309,0,negative,"The Deficit Problem Is Exaggerated. WASHINGTON — The Federal budget deficit is a genuine problem, but the problem has been exaggerated by two myths: first, that it will abort the expansion by crowding out private borrowers, and, second, that the Federal debt will impose an intolerable burden on our children.</br></br>Economic stagnation after 1978 and the 1980 and 1981 downturns contributed to the deficit by reducing receipts and raising outlays for unemployment compensation and welfare payments. The economy did not emerge from its 1981-82 decline until inflation dropped and until it was suf-ficienUy stimulated by the tax cuts. Did those tax cuts and the deficit crowd out private borrowing? On the contrary, such borrowing has burgeoned to finance the strongest business expansion in more than 30 years. In the second quarter of 1984, Federal borrowing amounted to only about 21 percent of credit raised by all nonfi-nancial institutions. The combined borrowing by households and nonfi-nancial corporations jumped to 60 percent of the total.</br></br>What of the burden of the debt? Federal debt outstanding is now only about one-third of the gross national product, about half its ratio in the early 1950’s. Private debt, meanwhile, is nearly as large as the G.N.P. If the deficit can be reduced even gradually during the next five years from the current $174 billion, and the nominal G.N.P. (not adjusted for inflation) continues to grow on average at a moderate 8 to 9 percent, the ratio of outstanding debt to the G.N.P. will remain near present levels. Ten years ago, interest on the Federal debt amounted to about 1.5 percent of the G.N.P. The ratio began climbing in 1979 and 1980 because of the jump in interest rates. Interest rates have eased since their 1980-81 peaks, and, with the economy growing again, the ratio has leveled off at about 3 percent.</br></br>Whether the Federal debt will be a greater burden than in the past will depend on how fiscal policy affects growth. If tax reductions or Government investments increase the economy’s productive capacity, growth in income will more than cover interest payments, and future generations will be better off, not worse off. The 1981 tax cuts produced the greatest capital spending boom of the postwar period. Why is that important? Growth in manufacturing capacity is accelerating and productivity in the nonfarm business sector is increasing at a 4 percent rate. Much of the gain in productivity is a cyclical rebound, but an increasing share is undoubtedly a result of new investment.</br></br>boom going, we will reap faster-than-average growth in capacity and productivity. Moreover, labor force participation is increasing again. It is possible, therefore, that higher than average growth is achievable without accelerating inflation. Capital spending is the economy’s fountain of youth. It can work the same wonders here that it has in Japan. Because the economy’s precise growth potential is uncertain, further deficit reduction measures may be necessary. Should we lower spending or raise taxes? The tax route is the wrong one. First of all, the deficit cannot be reduced only by increasing tax rates for high-income brackets. A10 percent surcharge on incomes over $100,000 would raise only a few billion dollars. A tax increase that would make a significant dent in the deficit would have to be broad-based — well over $1,000 per family. That’s not just an ivory-towered calculation.

WASHINGTON — Asked last week about President Reagan’s proposal that Congress work with the White House to make a $100 billion “down payment” on the Federal deficit. Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill Jr. answered: “Do I think it’s political? Yeah, I believe it’s political.” Capitol Hill’s leading Democrat was commenting on Republican attitudes toward deficit reduction. But his statement was an apt summary of the approach of both parties. Almost everybody is worrying about politics first and policy second.</br></br>The Democrats are searching for issues to turn against the President and hoping the deficit is one of the few that might work during a robust economic recovery. The Republicans are trying to defuse the possible political dangers, and neither party wants to tackle difficult choices in an election year. So failure in last week’s first round was widely predicted before it began. The talks ended with a date for another session not set, and Congress on its way out of town for a 10-day recess.</br></br>In the private session at Blair House, the Republican approach was to push the Administration’s three-year package of “noncontentious” measures, both cost-cutters and revenue-raisers, on the ground that they could be passed easily apart from the regular budget process in an otherwise distracted election year. Congressional Democrats branded the offer a “charade” composed of “nickel and dime things” too small to make a significant dent In the $180 billion Federal deficit the White House projects for die 1985 fiscal year and the billions more after that. They found their argument bolstered by Administration acknowledgment that passage of the entire package would have little impact next year.</br></br>The Democrats’ counterstrategy was to match the Republicans and raise them. They would resume the deficit talks, they said, only if Republicans agreed to reductions in military spending; Representative Jim Wright of Texas, the majority leader, suggested a one-year stretchout in increases for the Pentagon that could save another $100 billion. The expectation was that the Administration would scuttle the talks, and thus leave itself open to the charge that it doesn’t truly care about the deficit. James A. Baker 3d, White House chief of staff, saw the bet with one of his own. He sent a letter to Congressional Democrats, asking for another meeting and promising to discuss military spending, though not exclusively. Meanwhile, Senator Howard H.

But to a President thinking about running for re-election, a Presidential adviser deciding what economic medicine to prescribe or a securities analyst counseling customers about managing their money, the nuances matter a great deal.</br></br>Last week, the specter of a weaker economy in 1979 drew a little closer after the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to raise crude oil prices 14.5 percent. Before next year is out, there may well be a raging debate about how healthy or sick the American economy is, and what the Government should do. The debate could well center on whether recession or some other term best describes what is happening.</br></br>The best layman's definition of recession remains the hoary quip: “A recession is when you lose your job. A depression is when I lose mine.” Plainly, recession is milder than depression. Economists call the six postwar downturns in economic activity ""recessions,” reserving “depression” for the deeper and longer decline of the 1930’s. The working definition most economists employ is “a decline in real G.N.P. for two consecutive quarters.” G.N.P. stands for gross national product, the sum of all economic activity. For the third quarter of 1978, the Commerce Department reported last week, that rate was 52,136 billion; for the fourth, it is projected to be higher. The total for the whole year will be the average of the four quarterly rates, and the difference between this year’s ""real” G.N.P. — or G.N.P. stripped of increases due to higher prices—and last year’s will be this year’s economic growth. For next year, forecasts have been scattered; one tabulation found growth predictions ranging from 0.8 to 3.9 percent.</br></br>The two-quarter thumbnail explanation was coined by Arthur M. Okun, he recalls, as an ""an empirical characterization rather than a definition,” in the early 1960’s, before he became President Johnson’s chief economic adviser. The formal definition, Mr. Okun explains, belongs to the National Bureau of Economic Research. As Geoffrey H. Moore, the private organization’s director of business cycle research, admits, it is long and complicated. Mr. Okun’s rule-of-thumb, he says, describes all the postwar recessions.</br></br>But as Mr. Okun and other authorities agree, the formal definition is not enough. Arthur F. Bums, former Federal Reserve Board chairman, says he would use two tests of recession: G.N.P. and employment. It is almost certain that if G.N.P. turns down, employment does also. But they needn’t proceed in lockstep. Indeed, the relative overall decline in employment has been diminishing in the last 30 years. In the recessions of 194849, 1953-54 and 1957-58, employment dropped more than 3 percent. In 1960-61, 1969-70 and 1974-75, each dip was less than 3 percent.",test,nyt_123552100,,negative

Although the recession has ended, the wages of more than 100 million workers are still stagnant, endangering the consumer spending that sustains the fragile recovery.</br></br>The stagnation in total wages paid to the nation’s employees outside of government is now a year old, according to newly revised government data, which paints a bleak picture of the economy. The rising cost of company-sponsored health insurance is also taking a bite out of take-home pay. Rather than pay the premium increases themselves, companies are deducting much of the additional cost from employee pay-checks.</br></br>The recovery’s survival may be riding on how people perceive these constraints on their wages, which they are just beginning to notice, says Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumer Sentiment. “People are telling us about smaller paychecks,” he said. Meager raises or no raises at all are a problem for them, he added, “but what they are really noticing is the loss of overtime hours, which effectively lowers their income. And they are beginning to cut back on spending.”</br></br>Not everyone accepts the new wage revisions published by the Commerce Department as proof of stagnation. A broader measure of personal income, one that includes items like Social Security benefits and unemployment insurance as well as wages, has risen recently. Some forecasters have seized on this improvement to argue that the economy is generating enough new income to strengthen the recovery by early next year.</br></br>But there is an obstacle to optimism.
